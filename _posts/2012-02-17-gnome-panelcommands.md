Gnome PanelCommands is a Gnome Shell Extension which lets you execute arbitrary commands from you top panel.


To install:

- Extract the zip and place the panelcommands@dctr.github.io folder in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
- Modify the \_createMenu function in extension.js to provide the commands you want to run
- Reload Gnome Shell (Alt + F2 -> r)

The extension is not as comfortable as [MyLauncher](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/437/mylauncher/), but first it was designed well earlier, second it is already compatible with the current Gnome Shell version.
