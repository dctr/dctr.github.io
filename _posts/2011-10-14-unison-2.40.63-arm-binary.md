title: Unison 2.40.63 ARM Binary
---
Here you can download a binary of Unison 2.40.63 for ARM CPUs.


I build this binary for my DreamPlug, but it is comaptible with all **armel** devices. I ran it on the following devices:

- DreamPlug
- HP Pre
- HP Pre3
- HP Touchpad

And it most certainly runs on SheevaPlugs too.

Please contact me, if you ran it successfully on a device, so i can add it to this list.
