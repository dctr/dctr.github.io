For a few reasons i recently started developing my own template engine, mute.js, based on [underscore.js'](http://underscorejs.org/) \_.template() function. Mute.js is small and simple but yet easy to use.


Today, i finished my work on version 2.0 and took that as a reason to do this post.

You can find further information about mute.js on [my mute.js project page](http://dctr.github.io/mute.js), where you can also find the documentation and download the latest version.
