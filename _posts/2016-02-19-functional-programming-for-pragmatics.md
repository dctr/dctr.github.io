I just held a presentation about functional programming with less focus on math but on practical usage in Java.

The presentation was in German, can be found the [respective GitHub repo](https://github.com/dctr/presentation-funktionale-programmierung), and can be [viewed online](http://dev.genitopia.org/presentation-funktionale-programmierung/#/).
